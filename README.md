I am learning how to use Git for collaborative software development.

## .gitignore
This file ignores compiled Java files (.jar, .class) and the Maven 'target' directory.

## Branch Strategy
author/idea-sprint: Used by the author for new content creation.
editor/review: Used by the editor to review and merge changes.

## Layout Files
- TOC.md: The zine's table of contents.
- style.md: The zine's style guide.
